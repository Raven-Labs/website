## Overview

We can provide you with a modern mobile phone with high security and privacy, by installing a secure OS free from Google's invasive tactics which is called GrapheneOS.  We will also provision some setup on this phone.

Optionally, we can set up a secondary area on your phone which has some Google services, albeit less invasive than the average smartphone and completely separated from your main area, keeping your data safe. This may be required for some apps which depend on google code such as games or banking apps.

## Phone Choice
We can offer you a choice of two models of secure phone: one based on the Pixel 4a and another based on the more modern Pixel 6.

|Pixel 6| Pixel 4A|
