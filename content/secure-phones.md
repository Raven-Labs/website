## Overview

We can provide you with a modern mobile phone with high security and privacy, by installing a secure OS free from Google's invasive tactics which is called GrapheneOS.  We will also provision some setup on this phone.

Optionally, we can set up a secondary area on your phone which has some Google services, albeit less invasive than the average smartphone and completely separated from your main area, keeping your data safe. This may be required for some apps which depend on google code such as games or banking apps.

## Phone Choice
Ironically, according to our research the Google Pixel line of phones tend to be the most secure and best phones to de-google. This is because of the dedicated security chips developed by Google, and Google's decision to let you remove the built in Google software and replace it with custom software if you so choose.

You may have heard of other privacy-orientated mobile operating systems, such as LineageOS and CalyxOS, although these have some serious security shortcomings. In LineageOS's case is the weakening of built in protections to allow for wider phone compatibility, and in CalyxOS's case their inclusion of a half-baked unsecure reimplementation of Google's software weakens the overall security of the phone.

The Linux distros for phones in their current state are quite unstable and more difficult to use. On top of this, Linux phones have much lower hardware security, as well as weaker security restrictions for apps compared to what Android-based operating systems have.

We can offer you a choice of two models of secure phone: one based on the Pixel 4a and another based on the more modern Pixel 6.
