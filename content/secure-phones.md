## Overview

We can provide you with a modern mobile phone with high security and privacy, by installing a secure, "de-googled" OS called GrapheneOS and provisioning some setup on this phone.

Optionally, we can provision a secondary area on your phone which has some Google services, albeit less invasive than the average smartphone and completely separated from your main area, keeping your data safe, if you require apps which depend on these services such as some banking apps.

## Phone Choice
We can offer you a choice of two models of secure phone: one based on the Pixel 4a and another based on the more modern Pixel 6.

|Pixel 6| Pixel 4A|
