## Overview

We provide secure modern smartphones that respect your privacy. We install a secure OS that isn't controlled by Google called GrapheneOS. Phones are set up to your specification with essential apps and features that respect your privacy while allowing users to enjoy their high-end device without data collection and tracking.

Optionally, we can set up some Google services in a restricted jail to let users install apps that require google code (commonly games and banking apps) while still keeping your private photos, files and messages far away from Google.

At Raven Labs we understand the importance of truely private communication so our phones come with a guide on the best apps for keeping chats private and out of reach of companies and governments that censor and survail private communications.

## Phone Choice
Ironically, according to our research the Google Pixel line of phones are the most secure and best phones to de-google. This is because of the dedicated security chips developed by Google, and Google's decision to let you remove the built in Google software and replace it with custom software if you so choose.

You may have heard of other privacy-orientated mobile operating systems, such as LineageOS and CalyxOS, although these have some serious security shortcomings. In LineageOS's case is the weakening of built in protections to allow for wider phone compatibility, and in CalyxOS's case their inclusion of a half-baked unsecure reimplementation of Google's software weakens the overall security of the phone.

The Linux distros for phones in their current state are quite unstable and more difficult to use. On top of this, Linux phones have much lower hardware security, as well as weaker security restrictions for apps compared to what Android-based operating systems have.

We offer two types of secure smartphone: one based on the Pixel 4a and another based on the more recent Pixel 6.
